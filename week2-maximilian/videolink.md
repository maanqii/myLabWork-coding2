When I was first introduced to JavaScript last semester, I knew nothing about code and then was thrilled when I made my first curved project.
So when I was similarly exposed to C++, which I knew absolutely nothing about, I chose to port my project that initially excited me: Sound Ripple to OF.

The gentle colors and regular music and dynamic ripples match the original ripples, using the SIMPLE example from the kku library instead.
