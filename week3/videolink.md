In the third week, we learned about inheritance and polymorphism. When a new object has the same properties as the original object, we can use "inheritance" to copy the properties of the original object, which can reduce code repetition and improve code reusability.

I named another object 'miniboid' and was stopped by my teacher when I tried to name it boid2, which seems to be a very inappropriate name. miniboid is my subclass, change them to black and white and entangle and separate them from each other.
